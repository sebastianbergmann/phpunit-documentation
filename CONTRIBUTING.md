## Fixing an Issue

The steps here may change in the future, but currently if you wish to contribute to the PHPunit documentation, follow the following steps:

1. Fork the [PHPunit Repository](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit-documentation/issues)
2. Clone your fork to your local environment.
3. The documentation files exist as XML files inside the `src/` directory, organized by version and locale, e.g. `src/5.2/en/`.  The last URL segment from [https://phpunit.de/manual/](https://phpunit.de/manual/) corresponds to the XML file basename, e.g. the `https://phpunit.de/manual/4.8/en/organizing-tests.html` page is generated by the `src/4.8/en/organizing-tests.xml` file.  When making an edit to an existing page, make the changes to all versions that apply.  For example, if you wish to edit the `organizing-tests.xml` file, you may need to make the change inside the `4.8`, `5.0`, `5.1`, and `5.2` directories.
4. Commit and push your fixes to your fork.
5. Open a pull request from your fork to the `sebastianbergmann/phpunit-documentation` repo.  Make sure you reference the relevant issue number.
