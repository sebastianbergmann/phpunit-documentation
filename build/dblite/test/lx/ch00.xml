<sect1><title>Foreword</title>

<para>In 1976, two landers named Viking set down on Mars and turned
their dish-shaped antennae toward earth. A few hours later, delighted
scientists and engineers received the first pictures from the surface
of another planet. Over the next few years, the viking mission
continued to collect thousands of images, instrument readings, and
engineering data, enough to keep researchers busy for decades, making
it one of the most successful science projects in history.</para>

<para>Of critical importance were the results of experiments designed
to detect signs of life in the martian soil. At the time, most
researchers considered the readings conclusive evidence against the
prospect of living organisms on Mars. A few, however, held out that
the readings could be interpreted in a more positive light. In the
late 1990's, when researchers claimed they found tiny fossils in a
piece of martian rock from Antarctica, they felt it was time to
revisit the viking experiment and asked NASA to republish the
results.</para>

<para>NASA staff retrieved the microfilm from storage and found it to
be largely intact and readable. They set out to scan the data and
publish it on CD-ROM. It seemed like a simple task at first. All they
had to do was sort out the desired experiment data from the other
information sent back from the space probes. But therein lay the
problem: how to extract specific pieces from a huge stream of munged
information. All of the telemetry from the landers came in a single
stream and was stored the same way. The soil sampling readings were
only a very tiny fraction among countless megabytes of diagnostics,
engineering data, and other stuff. It was like the proverbial needle
in a haystack.</para>

<para>To comb through all this data to extract the particular
information of interest would have been immensely expensive and
time-consuming. It would require detailed knowledge of the probe's
data communication specifications which were buried in documents that
were tucked away in storage or perhaps only lived in the heads of a
few engineers, long since retired. Someone might have to write
software to split the mess into parallel streams of data from
different instuments. All the information was there, it was just
nearly useless without a lot of work to decipher it.</para>

<para>Luckily, none of this ever had to happen. Someone with a good
deal of practical sense got in touch with the principal investigator
of the soil sampling experiment. He happened to have a yellowing copy
of the computer printout with analysis and digested results, all ready
for researchers to use. NASA only had to scan this information in and
republish it as it was, without the dreaded interpretation of aging
microfilm.</para>

<para>What this story dramatically shows us is that data is only as
good as the way it's packaged. Information is a valuable asset, but
its value depends a lot on its longevity, flexibility, and
accessibility. Can you get to your data easily? Is it clearly
labelled? Can you repackage it in any form you need? Can you provide
it to others without a hassle? These are the questions that the
Extensible Markup Language (XML) was designed to answer.</para>

<sect1><title>What's Inside</title>

<para>The book is organized into the following chapters:</para>

<para><xref linkend="intro"/> is an overview of XML and
some of its common uses. It's a springboard to the rest of the
book, introducing the main concepts that will be explained in
detail in following chapters.</para>

<para><xref linkend="core"/> describes the basic syntax of XML,
laying the foundation for understanding XML applications and
technologies.</para>

<para><xref linkend="mod"/> delves into the concepts of data
modelling, showing how to encode information with XML from simple
software preferences to complex narrative documents.</para>
