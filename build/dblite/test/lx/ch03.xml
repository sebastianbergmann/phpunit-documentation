<chapter id="mod"><title>Modelling Information</title>
<simplesect>

<para>Designing a markup language is a task similar to designing a
building. First, you have to ask some questions: Who am I building it
for? How will it be constructed? How will it be used? Do I give it
many small rooms or a few large ones? Will the rooms be generic and
interchangeable or specialized? Is there are role for the building,
like storage, office space, or factory work? It takes a lot of
planning to do it right.</para>

<para>When designing a markup language, there are many questions to
answer: What constitutes a document? How detailed do you need it to
be? How will it be generated? Is it flexible enough to handle every
expected situation? Is it generic enough to support different
formatting options and modes? Your decisions will help answer the most
basic question which is how can you represent a piece information as
XML?  This problem is part of the important topic of data
modelling.</para>

<para>In this chapter, we look at the ways in which different kinds of
data are modelled using XML. First, I'll show you the most basic kinds
of documents, simple collections of preferences for software
applications. The next category covers narrative documents with
characteristics such as text flows, block and inline elements, and
titled sections. Lastly, under the broad umbrella of "complex" data, I
talk about the myriad specialized markup languages for everything from
vector graphics to remote procedure calls.</para>

</simplesect>


<sect1><title>Simple Data Storage</title>

<para>In its most basic way, XML can be used like a database. Since
the early days of computer operating systems, data was stored in files
as tables, like the venerable /etc/passwd file:</para>

<programlisting>nobody:*:-2:-2:Unprivileged User:/nohome:/noshell
root:*:0:0:System Administrator:/var/root:/bin/tcsh
daemon:*:1:1:System Services:/var/root:/noshell
smmsp:*:25:25:Sendmail User:/private/etc/mail:/noshell</programlisting>

<para>It isn't too hard to parse data like this, but it has problems,
too. Certain characters aren't allowed. Each record lives on a
separate line, so data can't span lines. A syntax error is easy to
create and may be difficult to locate. XML has natural immunity to
these types of problems.</para>

<para>If you are writing a program that reads or saves data to a file,
there are good reasons to go with XML. Parsers have been written to
parse it already, so all you need to do is link to a library and use
one of several easy interfaces: SAX, DOM, XPath. Syntax errors are
easy to catch, and that too is automated by the parser. Technologies
like DTDs and Schema even check the structure and contents of elements
for you, to ensure completeness and ordering.</para>


<sect2><title>Dictionaries</title>

<para>A dictionary is a simple one-to-one mapping of properties to
values. A property has a name, or <firstterm>key</firstterm>, which is
a unique identifier. This is kind of like a table with two
columns. It's a simple but very effective way to serialize data.</para>

<para>In the Macintosh OSX operating system, Apple selected XML as its
format for preference files (called property lists). For the Chess program,
the property list is in a file called
<filename>com.apple.Chess.plist</filename>, listed here:</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist SYSTEM "file://localhost/System/Library/DTDs/PropertyList.dtd">
<plist version="0.9">
  <dict>
    <!--    KEY                       VALUE    -->
    <key>BothSides</key>            <false/>
    <key>Level</key>                <integer>1</integer>
    <key>PlayerHasWhite</key>       <true/>
    <key>SpeechRecognition</key>    <false/>
  </dict>
</plist>]]></programlisting>

<para>Here the data is stored in a tabular form within a
<sgmltag>dict</sgmltag> (dictionary) element. Each "row" is a pair of
elements, the first a <sgmltag>key</sgmltag> (the name of a property),
and the second a value. Values come in different types, such as the
boolean (true or false) and integer values you see here. The property
<literal>SpeechRecognition</literal> is assigned the boolean value FALSE,
which means that this feature is turned off in the program. The
property <literal>Level</literal> (difficulty level) is set to 1
because I'm a lousy chess player.</para>

<para>Here's a more complex example. It's the property list for system
sounds, <filename>com.apple.soundpref.plist</filename>:</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
  <dict>
    <key>AlertsUseMainDevice</key>  <integer>1</integer>
    <key>Devices</key>
    <dict>
      <key>InputDevices</key>
      <dict>
        <key>AppleDBDMAAudioDMAEngine:0</key>
        <dict>
          <key>Balance</key>        <real>0.0</real>
          <key>DeviceLevels</key>   <array>
                                      <real>0.5</real>
                                      <real>0.5</real>
                                    </array>
          <key>Level</key>          <real>0.5</real>
        </dict>
      </dict>
      <key>OutputDevices</key>
      <dict>
        <key>AppleDBDMAAudioDMAEngine:0</key>
        <dict>
          <key>Balance</key>        <real>0.0</real>
          <key>DeviceLevels</key>   <array>
                                      <real>1</real>
                                      <real>1</real>
                                    </array>
          <key>Level</key>          <real>1</real>
        </dict>
      </dict>
    </dict>
  </dict>
</plist>
]]></programlisting>

<para>In this example, the structure is recursive. A
<sgmltag>dict</sgmltag> can be avalue, allowing you to associate a key
with a whole set of settings. This allows for better organization by
creating categories like <literal>Devices</literal> and, under that,
subcategories like <literal>InputDevices</literal> and
<literal>OutputDevices</literal>. Notice also the
<sgmltag>array</sgmltag> type, which associates multiple values to one
key. Here, arrays are used to set the left and right volume
levels.</para> 

<para>I really like this way of storing preferences because it gives
me two ways to access the data. I can fiddle with settings in the
program's preferences window. The program would then update this XML
file the moment I click on the "OK" button. Alternatively, I can edit
the file myself. This may be an easier way to affect changes,
especially if some features aren't addressed in the GUI. I can edit it
in a text editor, or in the special application included with the
Macintosh OS called <application>Property List Editor</application>,
whose interface is very easy to use, as shown in <xref
linkend="mod-fig-ple"/>.</para>

<sect2><title>Records</title>

<para>A database typically stores information in
<firstterm>records</firstterm>, packages of data that follow the same
pattern. There are lots of records, each with the same set of data
fields, sometimes accessed by a unique identifier. For example, a
personnel database would have a record for each employee. <xref
linkend="model-ex-checkbook"/> is a simple record-style XML document
used for expense tracking.</para>

<example id="model-ex-checkbook">

</example>

<para>Each record is either a <sgmltag>debit</sgmltag> (expense) or a
<sgmltag>deposit</sgmltag> (income). It contains information about the
expense/income category, to whom I paid money (or received money
from), the date it happened, and a brief description. I have used
documents like this to balance my checkbook and summarize expenses in
tables so I can figure out where all my money goes.</para>

<para>How can you do this? I'll show you a quick program you can write
in Perl to calculate the ending balance in the previous example. <xref
linkend="model-ex-tabulate"/> shows a program that spits out a number
on the command line.</para>

<example id="model-ex-tabulate">
<title>Tabulate program</title>
<programlisting><![CDATA[#!/usr/bin/perl
use XML::LibXML;
my $parser = new XML::LibXML;
my $doc = $parser->parse_file( shift @ARGV );
my $balance = $doc->findvalue( '/checkbook/@balance-start' );
foreach my $record ( $doc->findnodes( '//debit' )) {
    $balance -= $record->findvalue( 'amount' );
}
foreach my $record ( $doc->findnodes( '//deposit' )) {
    $balance += $record->findvalue( 'amount' );
}
print "Current balance: $balance\n";]]></programlisting>
</example>

<para>The library XML::LibXML parses the document and stores it in an
object tree called <literal>$doc</literal>. This object supports two
interfaces: DOM and XPath. I used XPath queries as arguments to
the methods <function>findnodes()</function> and
<function>findvalue()</function> to reach into parts of the document
and pull out elements and character data. What could be easier?</para>

<para>Run the above program on the data file and you'll get:</para>

<screen>$ <userinput>tab data</userinput>
Current balance: 2781.37</screen>

<para>This example shows how XML makes reading and accessing data easy
for the programmer. What's more, the XML is flexible enough to allow
you to restructure the data without rewriting the program. If I were
to add new fields, such as an <literal>ID</literal> attribute or a
<sgmltag>time</sgmltag> element, it wouldn't effect the program a
bit. With an <foreignphrase>ad hoc</foreignphrase> solution like the
colon-delimited <filename>/usr/passwd</filename> file, you would not
have that kind of flexibility.</para>

</sect2>


<sect2><title>Good and Bad</title>

<para>XML is very good at modelling simple data structures like
the examples you've seen so far. We've seen all kinds of data types
represented: strings, integers, real numbers, arrays, dictionaries,
records. It's easier to modify than flat files, with minimal impact on
processing software, so you can add or remove fields as you
like. Writing programs to process the data is easy, since much of the
parsing work has been abstracted out, and plenty of interfaces are
available. Since XML support is ubiquitous, there are many ways to
modify the data.</para>

<para>The downside is that XML is not optimized for rapid, repetitive
access. An XML parser has to read the entire document to pick out even
a single detail, a huge overhead for one lookup. As the document
grows, the access time gets longer. Even storing it in memory isn't
much better, since searches are not optimized for finding records by
unique identifier. It's not as bad as doing an exhaustive search
through many files, but not as good as a true database.</para>

<para>Dedicated databases are designed to store data in a way that is
independant of the size and number of records. They are fast, but lack
the flexibility and ease of access of XML. A data processing program
must access the data indirectly, through an interface like SQL. This
can be cumbersome because data is stored in separate rows of a table,
and it make take several queries to reach the right data
point. Even worse, no two databases work the same way. Each has its
quirks and refinements that make it difficult or impossible to write
universal software without some kind of middleware adapter.</para>

<para>It comes down to a trade-off between convenience and
performance. XML maximizes flexibility and access, but is not ideally
suited for heavy, repetitive access. Databases are optimized for speed
and efficiency, but are harder to configure and write programs
for. And while XML is an open, universal format that is accessible by
all XML-compliant tools, there are no such guarantees with
databases.</para> 

</sect2>
</sect1>


<sect1><title>Narrative Documents</title>

<para>Now let's look at an important specific category of XML.  A
<firstterm>narrative document</firstterm> is one that contains text
meant to be read by people rather than machines. It includes web
pages, books, journals, articles, and essays. These documents have
some common traits. First, order of elements is inviolate. Try
reading a book backwards and you'll agree it's much less interesting
that way (and it gives away the ending). The text runs in a single
path called a <firstterm>flow</firstterm>, which the reader follows
from beginning to end.</para>

<para>Another key feature is that there are specialised element
groups, including sections, blocks, and inlines. Sections are
how you would imagine them: elements that break up the document into
parts like chapters, subsections, and so on. Blocks are rectangular
regions such as titles and paragraphs. Inlines are specially marked
strings inside those blocks for special formatting. <xref
linkend="mod-fig-flow"/> shows how a typical formatted document would
render these elements.</para>

<figure id="mod-fig-flow">
<title>Flows, blocks, inlines</title>
<graphic fileref="figs/lx2_0302.jpg"/>
</figure>

<sect2><title>Flows and sections</title>

<para>A narrative document contains at least one 
<firstterm>flow</firstterm>, a stream of text to be read continuously
from start to finish. It there are multiple flows, one will be the
dominant one, branching occasionally into short tangential flows like
sidebars, notes, tips, warnings, footnotes, and so on. The main flow
is typically formatted as a column, while other flows are often in
boxes interrupting the main flow, or moved to the side or the very
end, with some kind of link pointing to it (e.g. a footnote
symbol).</para>

<para>Markup for flows are varied. Some XML applications like
XHTML do not support more than one flow. Others, like DocBook, have
rich support for flows, encapsulating them as elements inside the main
flow. The best representation allows flows to be moved around, floated
within the confines of the formatted page.</para>

<para>The main flow is broken up into <firstterm>sections</firstterm>,
hierarchical divisions that organize the document by topics, usually
with titles or <firstterm>heads</firstterm>. For example, a book is
divided into chapters, which are subdivided by sections and
subsections and subsubsections. It is often convenient to treat these
divisions as separate entities which can be stored in their own files,
imported using the external entity mechanism. This is useful if
sections are being worked on in parallel by different people, such as
with articles of a journal.</para>

<para>There are common two ways in which sections are coded. The
first, and less flexible, scheme is where the section head is tagged,
but there is no element to denote the boundary of the section, like
this:</para>

<programlisting>&lt;bighead&gt;A major section&lt;/bighead&gt;
&lt;head&gt;A cute little section&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;Some text...&lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;head&gt;Another cute little section&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;paragraph&gt;Some text...&lt;/paragraph&gt;</programlisting>

<para>The other, better scheme is where the section has definite
boundaries created by a container element:</para>

<programlisting>&lt;section&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;A major section&lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;subsection&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;A cute little section&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;paragraph&gt;Some text...&lt;/paragraph&gt;
  &lt;/subsection&gt;
  &lt;subsection&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;Another cute little section&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;paragraph&gt;Some text...&lt;/paragraph&gt;
  &lt;/subsection&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;</programlisting>

<para>The first is called a <firstterm>flat</firstterm> structure and
is less desireable because it relies on presentational details to
devine where parts of the document begin and end. In this case, a
bigger head means a larger section is beginning, and a small head
indicates a subsection is starting. It's harder to write software to
recognize these details than the other kind, the
<firstterm>hierarchical</firstterm> structure. XHTML, for example, is
typically flat. In contrast, the markup language DocBook is
hierarchical. We'll see examples of these shortly.</para>

</sect2>


<sect2><title>Blocks and inlines</title>

<para>A <firstterm>block</firstterm> is a type of element that
contains a segment of a flow and typically formats as a rectangular
region, separated from other blocks by vertical space above and
below. Unlike sections, blocks hold mixed content, both character 
data and elements. Examples of blocks are paragraphs, section heads,
and list items.</para>

<para>Elements inside blocks are called <firstterm>inline
elements</firstterm> because they follow the line of text. They begin
and end within the lines scanning from left to right (or right to
left, if we're reading Arabic). Inlines are used to mark words and
phrases for emphasis or special formatting from the surrounding text
in the block. Examples include emphasis, glossary terms, and important
names.</para>

<para>Here is an example of a block with inlines:</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[<para><person>R. Buckminster Fuller</person> once 
said, <quote>When people learned to do <emphasis>more</emphasis> with
<emphasis>less</emphasis>, it was their lever to industrial
success.</quote></para>]]></programlisting>

<para>The element <sgmltag>para</sgmltag> is a block, containing
a whole paragraph of text. Inside it are three inline element types:
<sgmltag>person</sgmltag>, <sgmltag>quote</sgmltag>, and
<sgmltag>emphasis</sgmltag>. The <sgmltag>quote</sgmltag> element
actually contains elements itself (the two <sgmltag>emphasis</sgmltag>
elements), but is still considered an inline, since it begins and ends
within the text line of the block.</para>

<para>There are different reasons to use inlines. One is to control
how the text formats. In this case, a formatter will probably replace
the start and end tags with quote characters. For
<sgmltag>emphasis</sgmltag> elements, it might render the contents in
italic, underline, or bold.</para>

<para>Another role for inlines is to mark text for special
processing. The <sgmltag>person</sgmltag> element may have no special
treatment by the formatter, but could be useful in other ways.
Marking items as "person", "place", "definition", or whatever,
makes it possible to mine data from the document for generating
indexes, glossaries, search tables, and much more.</para>

</sect2>


<sect2><title>Complex Structures</title>

<para>Not all structures found in narrative documents can be so
readily classified as blocks or inlines. A table is not really a
block, but an array of blocks. An illustration has no character data
so it can't be considered a block. Lists also have their own rules,
with indentation, autonumbering or bullets, and nesting. Objects like
these are necessary complications for the narrative model.</para>

<para>How to handle these structures is a tricky subject, but there
are some assumptions you can make. For one thing, they usually remain
inside the flow, interrupting the surrounding text briefly. It is as
if the XML is broken up with little islands of complex markup within
an ocean of narrative-style markup.</para>

<para>Structures like figures and tables may
<firstterm>float</firstterm> within the flow, meaning that the
formatter has some leeway in where to place the objects to produce the
best page layout. If a figure would cross a pagebreak in one place,
the formatter may be able to reposition it elsewhere. For this reason,
such objects usually have captions with references in the text that
sound like "the data is summarized in table 5". A simple attribute
like <literal>float="yes"</literal> may be sufficient to represent
this capability in the markup.</para>

<para>Complex objects behave a little like blocks in that they are
usually separated vertically from each other and surrounding
text. They may have some of the spacing and padding properties as
well. But these details are usually settled in a stylesheet. XML
doesn't (or shouldn't) tangle with presentational aspects any more
than it has to.</para>

</sect2>


<sect2><title>Metadata</title>

<para><firstterm>Metadata</firstterm> is information about the
document that is not part of the flow. It's useful to keep with the
rest of the document, but is not formatted, or else is formatted in a
special way, such as on a title page in an arbitrary order. Examples
include author name, copyright date, publisher, revision history,
ISBN, catalog number.</para>

<para>In XHTML, for example, there is a whole part of the document,
the <sgmltag>head</sgmltag> element, to hold metadata like the title,
descriptive terms for search engines, links to stylesheets, and so
on. In DocBook, metadata can be associated with individual sections,
which is useful to associate authors with invidual articals, for
example.</para> 

</sect2>


<sect2><title>Linked Objects</title>

<para>The last bunch of oddball elements often found in narrative
documents can be classified as <firstterm>linked
objects</firstterm>. These are elements which act as bookmarks in a
document. The way you might stick a paperclip on a page or bend over
the corner to mark the page is how they work.</para>

<para>First, there is the <firstterm>cross reference</firstterm>, an
element that refers to a section or object somewhere else in the
document. When formatted, it may be replaced with generated text, such
as the section number or title of the referred object. It may be
turned into a hyperlink, which when clicked transports the user
directly to the object.</para>

<para>Another kind of linkend object is an invisible marker. It has
no overt function in the flow other than to mark a location so that
later, when generating an index, you can calculate a page number or
create a hyperlink. Index items often span a range of pages, so you
might want to capture the range with two markers, one at the beginning
and one at the end.</para>

</sect2>


<sect2><title>XHTML</title>

<para>Good old HTML is the markup language we are all familiar
with. Simple, pretty, easy to learn, it has turned the Internet from
an obscure plaything of a few academics to a must-have utility for
everyone. Its success can be attributed to the "good enough" principle
of web design. It's good enough to model almost any simple document as
long as you don't mind its limitations: single column format, flat
structure, and lack of page-oriented features.</para>

<para>The simplicity that made HTML so popular with novice publishers
is frustrating to professionals. Graphic designers crave better page
layout capability and stylesheet granularity. Web developers want
better structure and navigation. Librarians and researchers want more
detailed metadata and searchability. Users with special needs want
more localization and customization. Poor HTML has been pushed to do
far more than it was ever designed to do.</para>

<para>None of this makes HTML a bad markup language. It will not go
away anytime soon, because it does a job well. It is a basic markup
language for electronic display and cross-document linking. However,
it is now just one star in a constellation of XML languages. If you
need to do more, you will be able to select other kinds of narrative
markup languages such as DocBook, which we will discuss later in the
chapter.</para>

<para>First, let me clear up something which may be confusing to
you. I use the terms HTML and XHTML interchangeably. HTML is older
than XML, so its earlier incarnations do not follow all the rules of
well-formed XML documents. But XML was designed to make it as easy as
possible to get HTML documents into good XML form. HTML that is
well-formed XML is simply called XHTML. From now on, when I use the
term <wordasword>HTML</wordasword>, I mean
<wordasword>XHTML</wordasword>.</para>

<para>The best feature of HTML&mdash;so great it's responsible for
1/4th of the acronym&mdash;is hypertext: text that spans
documents. Where the Web concerned, the boundaries of documents are
quite blurred. As a result, documents are typically small and 
with many nonlinear flows. It's easy to get lost, so navigation aids,
such as links at the top, bottom, or margin are required. But the
basics, blocks and inlines, are the same.</para>

<para><xref linkend="mod-ex-xhtml"/> is a short XHTML
document. I've taken the content of a manual page for the Unix command
"cat" and reformatted it (from troff) as HTML. In this example, pay
attention to what are blocks, inlines, and complex objects like
lists.</para>

<para>This is a flat document structure. No elements were used to
contain and divide sections. Actually, HTML does have an element
called <sgmltag>div</sgmltag> which can be used as a section
container. However, it is not specifically designed as such, nor is it
used often in HTML documents. It is more usual to see
<sgmltag>div</sgmltag> used to divide regions for special
formatting. So I stand by my assertion that HTML is essentially a
flat-structured language.</para> 

<para>Now direct your attention to the inlines in the example,
<sgmltag>tt</sgmltag> and <sgmltag>i</sgmltag>. The names are
abbreviations for presentational terms, "teletype" and "italic". Right
there, you know there's something wrong. HTML has few element types,
but is meant to be used for many different types of document. So the
inventors picked elements that are generic and style-oriented. The
result is that we're forced to mark up terms the way we want them to
look rather than what they are.</para>

<para>HTML does supply an inline element called
<sgmltag>span</sgmltag>, which can be supplemented with an attribute
to fit all kinds of roles. For example, I could have used
<sgmltag>span class="command"</sgmltag> for the "cat" command and
<sgmltag>span class="citation"</sgmltag> for the reference to "UNIX
Style...". This would allow some flexibility in designing a
stylesheet. But it's really not using the full power of XML, since
it's just one element being stretched into many different
roles.</para> 

<para>Even some of the blocks have been forced into generic roles. The
paragraph under the head "SYNOPSIS" isn't really a paragraph, is it?
It's really something different, and I would prefer to use an element
strictly for synopses or code listings. But HTML has very few types of
block elements available and I am obligated to use whatever is
available.</para>

<para>There are good and bad points about using HTML in this
example. The good side is that HTML is easy to use, so I was able to
mark up the manual page in only a few minutes. With only a few 
element types to remember, I don't have to look in a book to know
which one to use and how it will look when formatted. The downside is
that now I have a document that is fit only for one purpose:
displaying in a web browser. A printout is likely to look
primitive. And for other purposes, like search engines and index
generators, the lack of granularity is likely to prevent me from doing
anything truly useful.</para>

<para>Until I need the extra functionality, I'm happy with HTML. But
if I ever plan to use a document in more than one way, I'll need to
explore other options. Something more specific to my brand of data
will fit better and give me more options. What I will show you next
is a markup language specifically designed for the information in the
last example.</para>

</sect2>


<sect2><title>DocBook</title>

<para>DocBook is a markup language designed specifically for technical
documentation, modelling everything from one-page user manuals to
thousand-page tomes. Like HTML, it predates XML and was first an SGML
application. Also like HTML, it has migrated to XML and works very
well in that framework.</para>

<para>Unlike HTML, DocBook is very large and comes with a steep
learning curve. Its elements are very specialized. There are blocks
for different kinds of code listings, scores of inlines for technical
terms, and many kinds of sections. Some users of DocBook even think
that it may be too big. Others feel it's too loose, allowing for so
many kinds of documents (within the technical documentation realm) it
suffers from the ambiguity that hinders HTML. But despite these
complaints, DocBook is and always has been the best markup language
for technical documentation.</para>

<para>It's not hard to find tools and support for DocBook. Many XML
editors (XMetaL and Adept, for example) come with DocBook packages
already configured. There are lots of stylesheets, schema, DTDs, and
other aids available. This support is likely to continue as various
groups from publishers to the Linux Documentation Project adopt it as
their default standard.</para>

<para>The first incarnation I'll show is a reformulation of the
previous example, shown below in <xref linkend="mod-ex-db"/>. You'll
see that the markup is a better fit for this type of data, and the
element types are much more specific. Also note the introduction of
section elements.</para>

<para>The first thing you'll notice is that DocBook is a lot more
verbose than HTML. The <sgmltag>variablelist</sgmltag> cousin to
HTML's definition list is a chore to type out. But there certainly is
no doubt about what an element stands for, which is necessary in a
markup language with so many elements. If every tag name was an
abbreviation of two letters, there'd be no hope of ever memorizing a
fraction of the langauge.</para>

<para>The structure of the document element,
<sgmltag>refentry</sgmltag> is highly specialized. Whereas HTML adopts
a strategy where every document has the same overall structure,
DocBook is very closely bound to the type of document you're
authoring. If this were a book, for example, it would look completely
different. The metadata is specific to reference pages, and even the
sections are called <sgmltag>refsect1</sgmltag>, meaning that they are
specific to a reference entry.</para>

<para>The types of inlines are much more numerous than in
HTML, with highly specific names like <sgmltag>option</sgmltag>,
<sgmltag>command</sgmltag> and <sgmltag>citetitle</sgmltag>. The
blocks, too, are more differentiated. Notice that we now have a
<sgmltag>synopsis</sgmltag> element to address a complaint I made
about the HTML example.</para>

<para>The tradeoffs of HTML are reversed here. DocBook is much more
complex and intricate than HTML, making it harder to learn and
use. But the more specific vocabulary of this markup language makes it
much more flexible in terms of formatting and processing. With
flexibility may come more work, however, since someone will have to
set up a big stylesheet to handle all the elements. If you purchase a
package solution, as is possible with many high-end XML editors, much
of this work may be done for you.</para>

<para>This example only shows a small part of DocBook. I'd like to
give you another taste, so that you can see the breadth of its
capabilities. <xref linkend="mod-ex-db2"/> shows a more traditional
narrative document, a book. Here you will see a wide variety of
section elements (chapters, sections) and complex structures (table,
figure, list). Throughout the example, I've interspersed comments to
explain some of the elements.</para>

Notice that all the major components (preface, chapter, sections)

how an element can be used in different contexts. In a formatted copy
of this document, the titles in different levels will be rendered
differently, some large and others small. A stylesheet will use the

<sgmltag>title</sgmltag>) to determine how to format it.

<sgmltag>orderedlist</sgmltag> is one of many types of lists

the object is a table, so we might expect to see something like "Table

Here is another complex object, a table. DocBook's DTD doesn't define this

an XML application called CALS (Continuous Acquisition and Life-Cycle

of SGML to improve its documentation. The CALS table model is very
flexible and robust, so the DocBook framers felt it easier just to
borrow it than try to reinvent the wheel.

<sect1><title>Complex Data</title>

<para>XML really shines when data is complex. It turns the most
abstract concepts into concrete databases ready for processing by
software. Multimedia formats like Scaleable Vector Graphics (SVG) and
Syncronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL) map pictures and
movies into XML markup. Complex ideas in the scientific realm are just
as readily coded as XML, as proven by MathML (equations), the Chemical
Markup Language (chemical formulae), and the Molecular Dynamics
Language (molecule interactions).</para>


<sect2><title>Elements as Objects</title>

<para>The reason XML is so good at modelling complex data is that the
same building blocks for narrative documents&mdash;elements and
attributes&mdash; can apply to any composition of objects and
properties. Just as a book breaks down into chapters, sections,
blocks, and inlines, many abstract ideas can be deconstructed into
discrete and hierarchical components. Vector graphics, for
example, are composed of a finite set of shapes with associated
properties. You can represent each shape as an element and use
attributes to hammer down the details.</para>

<para>SVG is a good example of how to represent objects as
elements. Take a gander at the simple SVG document in <xref
linkend="mod-ex-svg"/>. Here we have three different shapes
represented by as many elements: a common rectangle, an ordinary
circle, and an exciting polygon. Attributes in each element customize
the shape, setting color and spatial dimensions.</para>

<para>Vector graphics are scaleable, meaning you can stretch the image
vertically or lengthwise without any loss of sharpness. The image
processor just recalculates the coordinates for you, leaving you to
concentrate on higher concepts like composition, color, and
grouping.</para>

<para>SVG adds other benefits too. Being an XML application, it can be
tested for corruption (i.e. it's not well-formed), can be edited in
any generic XML editor, and is easy to write software for. DTDs and
Schema are available to check for missing information, and provide an
easy way to distinguish between versions.</para>

<para>Are there limitations? Of course. XML is not so good when it
comes to raster graphics. This other category of graphics formats
including TIFF, GIF and JPEG, renders an image based on pixel
data. Instead of a conceptual representation based on shapes, it's a
big, fat array of numbers. You could store this in XML, certainly, but
the benefits of markup are irrelevent since elements would only
increase the document's size without organizing the data
well. Furthermore, these formats typically use compression to force
the huge amount of data into more manageable sizes, something for
which markup would just be in the way.</para>

<para>What other concepts are ideally suited to XML representation?
How about chemicals? Every molecule has a unique blueprint consisting
of some combination of atoms and bonds. (Bonds are necessary because
there can be strong ionic bonds, weak bonds, double bonds, and so on.)
Languages like the Chemical Markup Language (CML) and Molecular
Dynamics Language (MoDL) follow a similar strategy to encode
molecules.</para>

<para><xref linkend="mod-ex-modl"/> shows how an imaginary molecule (a
triangle of three carbon atoms) would be coded in MoDL. Notice the
separation of <sgmltag>head</sgmltag> and <sgmltag>body</sgmltag> that
is reminiscent of HTML. The head is where we define atomic types,
giving them size and color properties for rendering. The body is where
we assemble the molecule using definitions from the head.</para>

<example id="mod-ex-modl">
<title>A molecule definition in MoDL</title>
<programlisting><![CDATA[<?xml version="1.0"?>
<modl>
   <head>
     <meta name="title" content="3 Carbon Atoms" />
     <DEFINE name="Carbon">
     <atom radius="0.2" color="1 1 0" />
     </DEFINE>
   </head>
   <body>
      <atom id="C0" type="Carbon" position="1 0 0" />
      <atom id="C1" type="Carbon" position="0 1 0" />
      <atom id="C2" type="Carbon" position="0 0 1" />
      <bond atom1="C0" atom2="C1" color="0 0 1" />
      <bond atom1="C1" atom2="C2" color="0 0 1" />
      <bond atom1="C2" atom2="C0" color="0 0 1" />
   </body>
</modl>]]></programlisting>
</example>

<para>For each atom instance, there is an element describing its type,
position, and a unique identifier (e.g. "C0" for the first carbon
atom). Each bond between atoms also has its own element, specifying
color and the two atoms it joins together. Notice the interplay
between <sgmltag>atom</sgmltag>s and <sgmltag>bond</sgmltag>s. The
unique identifers in the first group are the "hooks" for the second
group, which use attributes that refer to them. Unique identifiers are
another invaluable technique in expressing relationships between
concepts.</para>

<para>MoDL is a fascinating project by Dr. Swami Manohar Prof., Vijay
Chandru, and others at (UNIVERSITY NAME). The goal is not just to
model molecules, but to model their interactions. The language
contains elements to express motion as well as the static initial
positions. Elements represent actions applied to molecules, including
<sgmltag>translate</sgmltag> and <sgmltag>rotate</sgmltag>.</para>

<para>Software developed for this purpose converts MoDL documents into
a temporal-spatial format called Virtual Reality Markup Language
(VRML). When viewed in a VRML reader, you can watch as molecules dance
around and bump into each other! Read more about MoDL at <systemitem
role="url">http://violet.csa.iisc.ernet.in/~modl/</systemitem> and
VRML at (URL HERE).</para>

<para>Again, there are limitations. Movies, just like graphics, can be
vector-based or rastorized. Formats like MPEG and MOV are compressed
sequences of bitmaps, a huge amount of pixel information that XML
would not be good at organizing. Simple shapes bouncing around in
space are one thing, but complex scenes involving faces and puppy dogs
are probably never going to involve XML.</para>

<sect2><title>Presentation vs. Conceptual Encoding</title>

<para>Moving up in complexity is mathematics. The Math Markup Language
(MathML) attacks this difficult area with two different modes of
markup: presentational and conceptual. If we were talking about an
equation, there are two ways we could do it. I could say "the product
of A and B" or I could write on a chalkboard the more compact 
"A &times; B", both conveying the same idea to you. MathML allows you
to use either style and mix them together in a document.</para>

<para>As an example, consider the mathematical expression in <xref
linkend="mod-fig-frac"/>. This was generated with MathML and displayed
with Mozilla, which recognizes MathML as of version 1.1.</para>

<figure id="mod-fig-frac">
<title>A complex fraction</title>
<graphic fileref="figs/lx2_0303.jpg"/>
</figure>

<para><xref linkend="mod-ex-mathmlp"/> is the MathML document used to
generate this figure.</para>

</math>]]></programlisting>
</example>

<para><sgmltag>mfrac</sgmltag>, as you may have guessed, sets up a
fraction. It contains two elements called <sgmltag>mrow</sgmltag>, one
each for the top and bottom. Notice how the denomenator can itself
contain a fraction. Take this recursively as far as you wish and it's
perfectly legal in MathML. At the atomic level of expression are
numbers, variables and operators, which are marked up with simple
elements<sgmltag>mn</sgmltag> (number), <sgmltag>mi</sgmltag>
(identifier), and <sgmltag>mo</sgmltag> (operator).</para>

<para>Conceptual encoding (also known as <firstterm>Content
encoding</firstterm>) is the name given for the other mode of
MathML. It resembles functional programming, noteably LISP, in that
every sum, fraction, and product is represented as an operator
followed by arguments all wrapped up in an
<firstterm>apply</firstterm> element. <xref linkend="mod-ex-mathmlc"/>
shows how the equation (2a + b)<superscript>3</superscript> looks in
MathML's content mode.</para>

    </apply>
    <cn>3</cn>
  </apply>
</math>]]></programlisting>
</example>

<para>Why the two modes of MathML? One reason is flexibility of
authoring. But a more important reason is that each lends itself to a
different means of processing. Presentational encoding is easier to
render visually, and so is better supported in browsers and
such. Content encoding, because it's more regular and closer to the
meaning of the expression, is easier to process by a calculator-type
program.</para>

<para>With more support coming out for MathML in browsers and other
programs, its popularity is growing. For more information, read

<sect1><title>Documents Describing Documents</title>

<para>Many XML documents contain metadata, information about
themselves that help search engines to categorize them. But not
everyone takes advantage of the possibilities of metadata, making it
an unreliable prospect. And, unless you're using an exhaustive program
that spiders through an entire document collection, it's difficult to
summarize the set and choose a particular article from it. Making
matters worse, not all documents have the capability to describe
themselves, such as sound and graphics files. To address these
problems, a class of documents evolved that specialize in describing
other documents.</para>

<para>To fully describe different kinds of documents, these markup
languages have some interesting features in common. They list the time
documents have been updated using standard time formats. They label
the content type, be it text, image, sound, or something else. They
may contain text descriptions for a user to peruse. For international
documents, they may track the language encodings. Also interesting is
the way documents are uniquely identified: using a physical address or
some non-physical identifier.</para>


<sect2><title>Describing Media</title>

<para>Rich Site Summary (or Really Simple Syndication, depending on
whom you talk to) was created by Netscape Corp. to describe content on
websites. They wanted to make a portal that was customizeable,
allowing readers to subscribe to particular subject areas or
<firstterm>channels</firstterm>. Each time they returned to the site,
they would see updates on their favorite topics, saving them the
trouble of hunting around for this news on their own. Thus was born
the service known as <firstterm>content aggregation</firstterm>.</para>

<para>Since the time when there were a few, big content aggregators
like Netscape and Userland, the landscape has shifted to include
hundreds of smaller, more granular services. Instead of subscribing to
channels that mix together lots of different sources, you can
subscribe to individual sites for an even higher level of
customization. Everything from the BBC to a swarm of one-person
weblogs are at your disposal. Publishing has never been easier.</para>

<para>RSS works like the cover of a magazine, beckoning to you from
the newsstand. Splashed all over the cover graphic are the titles of
articles, like "Lose Weight with the Ice Cream Diet" and "Ten Things
the Government Doesn't Want You to Know About UFOs." At a glance, you
can decide whether you must have this issue, or if you can pass on it
and reach for <citetitle>National Geographic</citetitle>
instead. It saves you time and keeps the newsstand owner from yelling
at you for reading without buying.</para>

<para>There are models of publishing with RSS. The
<firstterm>pull</firstterm> model is where a content aggregator checks
an RSS file periodically to see if anything has been updated, pulling
in new articles as they appear. In the <firstterm>push</firstterm>
model, also called <firstterm>publish and subscribe</firstterm>, the
information source informs the content aggregator when it has
something new to offer. In both cases, RSS serves as a menu for the
aggregator (or the user logged into it) to decide whether the articles
are of interest.</para>

<para><xref linkend="mod-ex-rss"/> shows a sample of RSS describing a
fictional website. A file containing RSS typically will have the file
extension ".rdf" which stands for "resource description file". The
owner of a website will register this file with all the aggregators it
wants to be listed under and hope that people will be convinced by the
descriptions that it's interesting enough to subscribe to.</para>

</rss>]]></programlisting>
</example>

<para>The first thing inside the document element
<sgmltag>rss</sgmltag> is a <sgmltag>channel</sgmltag> element giving
a general overview of the site. In it, we find:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Descriptive text including a short title and longer
paragraph.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Administrative details: contact information, link to
the main page, copyright.</para></listitem> 
<listitem><para>Language identifier "en-us", which means that it's the
american variant of english (more about language encodings in <xref
linkend="int"/>).</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Time of last update, using a standard time format (RFC
822) recognized all over the Internet.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>After the <sgmltag>channel</sgmltag> come a series of elements
describing each item in the site. This example has two: a text
document and a sound file. Each has a corresponding
<sgmltag>item</sgmltag> element containing a text description, link to
the resource, and the date when it was posted.</para>

<para>For the sound file, there is an additional element,
<sgmltag>enclosure</sgmltag>, which provides some details about the
format. The <literal>type</literal> attribute gives the
<firstterm>content type</firstterm>, "audio/mp3". The format of this
description comes from the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
standard (RFC 2046).</para>

</sect2>


<sect2><title>Templates</title>

<para>Describing documents is also the job of the transformation
language XSLT. But in this case, we're talking about documents in the
<emphasis>future</emphasis>. XSLT generates new documents from old
ones, following rules in a transformation stylesheet. For each element
in the source document, there will be a rule dictating what to do with
it and its content. The rule can be explicit (defined by you), or
implicit (not finding a specific rule, the processor falls back on a
default one).</para>

<para>The way these rules are encoded in an XSLT document uses an
ingenious mechanism called a
<firstterm>template</firstterm>, which is a sample of a piece of the
result document. Some blanks need to be filled into the template, but
otherwise, you can see by looking at the template how the future
document will look.</para>

<para>Here is a typical XSLT stylesheet with a couple templates:</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[<xsl:stylesheet
  xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
  version="1.0">

  <!-- first template: how to process a <para> element -->
  <xsl:template match="para">
    <p>
      <xsl:apply-templates/>
    </p>
  </xsl:template>

  <!-- second template: how to process a <note> element -->
  <xsl:template match="note">
    <div class="note">
      <h3>NOTE</h3>
      <xsl:apply-templates/>
    </div>
  </xsl:template>
</xsl:stylesheet>]]></programlisting>

<para>The first template tells the XSLT processor what to output when it
comes across a <sgmltag>para</sgmltag> element in the source
document. The second is a rule for <sgmltag>note</sgmltag>
elements. In each case, the <sgmltag>template</sgmltag> element's
contents mirror a piece of the document to be created.</para>

<para>Notice the use of namespace prefix "xsl:" in some of the
elements. This is how the XSLT processor can tell the difference
between markup to be obeyed as instructions and markup to be
output. In other words, if there is no "xsl:" prefix, the markup is
treated as data and carried to the output document as-is. Some of the
instruction elements, like <sgmltag>xsl:apply-templates/</sgmltag>,
control the flow of processing, making the XSLT processor recurse
through the source document looking for more elements to
transform.</para>

<para>Similar to XSLT are XML Schemas. They use templates to describe
parts of documents as they <emphasis>should</emphasis> be, instead of
as they will be. In other words, a schema is a test to determine
whether a document can be labelled a valid instance of a
language.</para>

<para>Templates are a good design mechanism for documents describing
documents because they are modular and easy to understand. Instead of
looking at the whole document, you only have to imagine one element at
a time. Templates can be imported from other files and mixed to add
more flexibility.</para>
