    In <xref linkend="Astels2006" />, Dave Astels makes the following points:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_Programming">Extreme Programming</ulink>
        originally had the rule to test everything that could possibly break.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        Now, however, the practice of testing in Extreme Programming has evolved
        into <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Test-Driven Development</ulink>
        (see <xref linkend="test-driven-development"/>).
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        But the tools still force developers to think in terms of tests and
        assertions instead of specifications.
      </para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <blockquote>
    <attribution>Dave Astels</attribution>
    <title>So if it's not about testing, what's it about?</title>
    <para>
      It's about figuring out what you are trying to do before you run off
      half-cocked to try to do it. You write a specification that nails down a
      small aspect of behaviour in a concise, unambiguous, and executable form.
      It's that simple. Does that mean you write tests? No. It means you write
      specifications of what your code will have to do. It means you specify the
      behaviour of your code ahead of time. But not far ahead of time. In fact,
      just before you write the code is best because that's when you have as
      much information at hand as you will up to that point. Like well done TDD,
      you work in tiny increments... specifying one small aspect of behaviour at
      a time, then implementing it.
    </para>
    <para>
      When you realize that it's all about specifying behaviour and not writing
      tests, your point of view shifts. Suddenly the idea of having a Test class
      for each of your production classes is ridiculously limiting. And the
      thought of testing each of your methods with its own test method (in a 1-1
      relationship) will be laughable.

    The focus of <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_driven_development">Behaviour-Driven Development</ulink>
    is "the language and interactions used in the process of software development.
    Behavior-driven developers use their native language in combination with the
    ubiquitous language of <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_driven_design">Domain-Driven Design</ulink>
    to describe the purpose and benefit of their code. This allows the developers
    to focus on why the code should be created, rather than the technical details,
    and minimizes translation between the technical language in which the code
    is written and the domain language spoken by the" domain experts.

    <para>
      In this section, we will look at the example of a class that calculates
      the score for a game of bowling. The rules for this are as follows:
    </para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>The game consists of 10 frames.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>In each frame the player has two opportunities to knock down 10 pins.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>The score for a frame is the total number of pins knocked down, plus bonuses for strikes and spares.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>A spare is when the player knocks down all 10 pins in two tries.</para>
        <para>The bonus for that frame is the number of pins knocked down by the next roll.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>A strike is when the player knocks down all 10 pins on his first try.</para>
        <para>The bonus for that frame is the value of the next two balls rolled.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>
      <xref linkend="behaviour-driven-development.bowlinggame-example.examples.BowlingGameSpec.php"/>
      shows how the above rules can be written down as specification scenarios
      using <literal>PHPUnit_Extensions_Story_TestCase</literal>.
