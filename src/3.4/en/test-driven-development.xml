    Unit Tests are a vital part of several software development practices
    and processes such as Test-First Programming,
    <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_Programming">Extreme Programming</ulink>,
    and <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Test-Driven Development</ulink>.
    They also allow for <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_Contract">Design-by-Contract</ulink>
    in programming languages that do not support this methodology with
    language constructs.

  <para>
    You can use PHPUnit to write tests once you are done programming.
    However, the sooner a test is written after an error has been introduced,
    the more valuable the test is. So instead of writing tests months after
    the code is "complete", we can write tests days or hours or minutes after
    the possible introduction of a defect. Why stop there? Why not write the
    tests a little before the possible introduction of a defect?
  </para>

  <para>
    Test-First Programming, which is part of Extreme Programming and
    Test-Driven Development, builds upon this idea and takes it to the
    extreme. With today's computational power, we have the opportunity to
    run thousands of tests thousands of times per day. We can use the
    feedback from all of these tests to program in small steps, each of
    which carries with it the assurance of a new automated test in addition
    to all the tests that have come before. The tests are like pitons,
    assuring you that, no matter what happens, once you have made progress
    you can only fall so far.
  </para>

  <para>
    When you first write the test it cannot possibly run, because you are
    calling on objects and methods that have not been programmed yet. This
    might feel strange at first, but after a while you will get used to it.
    Think of Test-First Programming as a pragmatic approach to following the
    object-oriented programming principle of programming to an interface
    instead of programming to an implementation: while you are writing the
    test you are thinking about the interface of the object you are
    testing -- what does this object look like from the outside. When you
    go to make the test really work, you are thinking about pure
    implementation. The interface is fixed by the failing test.

    <para>
      The point of <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Test-Driven Development</ulink>
      is to drive out the functionality the software actually needs, rather
      than what the programmer thinks it probably ought to have. The way it
      does this seems at first counterintuitive, if not downright silly, but
      it not only makes sense, it also quickly becomes a natural and elegant
      way to develop software.

    <title>BankAccount Example</title>

    <para>
      In this section, we will look at the example of a class that represents
      a bank account. The contract for the <literal>BankAccount</literal>
      class not only requires methods to get and set the bank account's
      balance, as well as methods to deposit and withdraw money. It also
      specifies the following two conditions that must be ensured:
    </para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>The bank account's initial balance must be zero.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The bank account's balance cannot become negative.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>
      We write the tests for the <literal>BankAccount</literal> class before we
      write the code for the class itself. We use the contract conditions as the
      basis for the tests and name the test methods accordingly, as shown in
      <xref linkend="test-driven-development.bankaccount-example.examples.BankAccountTest.php" />.

    <para>
      We now write the minimal amount of code needed for the first test,
      <literal>testBalanceIsInitiallyZero()</literal>, to pass. In our
      example this amounts to implementing the <literal>getBalance()</literal>
      method of the <literal>BankAccount</literal> class, as shown in
      <xref linkend="test-driven-development.bankaccount-example.examples.BankAccount.php" />.

    <para>
      For the tests that ensure the second contract condition to pass, we now
      need to implement the <literal>withdrawMoney()</literal>,

      methods, as shown in

      These methods are written in a such a way that they raise an

      illegal values that would violate the contract conditions.

      Alternatively, you can use the static assertion methods provided by the
      <literal>PHPUnit_Framework_Assert</literal> class to write the contract
      conditions as design-by-contract style assertions into your code, as
      shown in <xref linkend="test-driven-development.bankaccount-example.examples.BankAccount3.php" />.
      When one of these assertions fails, an
      <literal>PHPUnit_Framework_AssertionFailedError</literal> exception
      will be raised. With this approach, you write less code for the contract
      condition checks and the tests become more readable. However, you add a
      runtime dependency on PHPUnit to your project.

    <para>
      By writing the contract conditions into the tests, we have used
      Design-by-Contract to program the <literal>BankAccount</literal> class.
      We then wrote, following the Test-First Programming approach, the
      code needed to make the tests pass. However, we forgot to write
      tests that call <literal>setBalance()</literal>,
      <literal>depositMoney()</literal>, and <literal>withdrawMoney()</literal>
      with legal values that do not violate the contract conditions.
      We need a means to test our tests or at least to measure their quality.
      Such a means is the analysis of code-coverage information that we will
      discuss next.
