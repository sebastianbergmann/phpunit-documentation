      You are looking at the documentation for a version of PHPUnit that is no
      longer supported.

    You have learned how to use unit tests to test your code. But how do you
    test your tests? How do you find code that is not yet tested -- or, in
    other words, not yet <emphasis>covered</emphasis> by a test? How do you
    measure testing completeness? All these questions are answered by a
    practice called Code Coverage Analysis. Code Coverage Analysis gives you
    an insight into what parts of the production code are executed when the
    tests are run.

    PHPUnit's Code Coverage Analysis utilizes the statement coverage
    functionality provided by the <ulink url="http://www.xdebug.org/">Xdebug</ulink>
    extension. An example of what statement coverage means is that if there is
    a method with 100 lines of code, and only 75 of these lines are actually
    executed when tests are being run, then the method is considered to have a
    code coverage of 75 percent.

    <xref linkend="code-coverage-analysis.figures.Code_Coverage.png" /> shows
    an excerpt from a Code Coverage report. Lines of code that were executed
    while running the tests are highlighted green, lines of code that are
    executable but were not executed are highlighted red, and "dead code" is
    highlighted orange. The number left to the actual line of code indicates
    how many tests cover that line.

      By default, all sourcecode files that contain at least one line of code
      that has been executed (and only these files) are included in the report.
      You can configure the sourcecode files that are included in the report
      using the <literal>PHPUnit_Util_Filter</literal> API (see

    <para>
      The blacklist is pre-filled with all sourcecode files of PHPUnit itself
      and the tests. When the whitelist is empty (default), blacklisting is used.
      When the whitelist is not empty, whitelisting is used. When whitelisting
      is used, each file on the whitelist is added to the code coverage report
      regardless of whether or not it was executed.
