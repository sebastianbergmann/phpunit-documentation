    In this chapter you will learn all about PHPUnit's code coverage
    functionality that provides an insight into what parts of the production
    code are executed when the tests are run. It helps answering questions such
    as:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        How do you find code that is not yet tested -- or, in other words, not
        yet <emphasis>covered</emphasis> by a test?
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>How do you measure testing completeness?</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>
    An example of what code coverage statistics can mean is that if there is a
    method with 100 lines of code, and only 75 of these lines are actually
    executed when tests are being run, then the method is considered to have a
    code coverage of 75 percent.
  </para>

  <para>
    <indexterm><primary>Xdebug</primary></indexterm>

    PHPUnit's code coverage functionality makes use of the
    <ulink url="https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/php-code-coverage">PHP_CodeCoverage</ulink>
    component, which in turn leverages the statement coverage functionality
    provided by the <ulink url="http://www.xdebug.org/">Xdebug</ulink>
    extension for PHP.
  </para>
  
  <note>
    <para>
      Xdebug is not distributed as part of PHPUnit. If you receive a notice
      while running tests that the Xdebug extension is not loaded, it means
      that Xdebug is either not installed or not configured properly. Before
      you can use the code coverage analysis features in PHPUnit, you should
      read <ulink url="http://xdebug.org/docs/install">the Xdebug installation guide</ulink>.

    Let us generate a code coverage report for a <literal>BankAccount</literal>
    class:

Generating report, this may take a moment.</screen>

  <para>
    <xref linkend="code-coverage-analysis.figures.Code_Coverage.png" /> shows
    an excerpt from a Code Coverage report. Lines of code that were executed
    while running the tests are highlighted green, lines of code that are
    executable but were not executed are highlighted red, and "dead code" is
    highlighted grey. The number left to the actual line of code indicates
    how many tests cover that line.

    Clicking on the line number of a covered line will open a panel (see

      The <literal>@covers</literal> annotation (see
      <xref linkend="appendixes.annotations.covers.tables.annotations"/>) can be
      used in the test code to specify which method(s) a test method wants to
      test. If provided, only the code coverage information for the specified
      method(s) will be considered.
      <xref linkend="code-coverage-analysis.specifying-covered-methods.examples.BankAccountTest.php"/>

      It is also possible to specify that a test should not cover 
      <emphasis>any</emphasis> method by using the 
      <literal>@coversNothing</literal> annotation (see
      <xref linkend="appendixes.annotations.coversNothing"/>). This can be
      helpful when writing integration tests to make sure you only 
      generate code coverage with unit tests.

      Sometimes you have blocks of code that you cannot test and that you may
      want to ignore during code coverage analysis. PHPUnit lets you do this
      using the <literal>@codeCoverageIgnore</literal>,
      <literal>@codeCoverageIgnoreStart</literal> and
      <literal>@codeCoverageIgnoreEnd</literal> annotations as shown in
      <xref linkend="code-coverage-analysis.ignoring-code-blocks.examples.Sample.php"/>.

}
?>]]></programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>
      The ignored lines of code (marked as ignored using the annotations)
      are counted as executed (if they are executable) and will not be
      highlighted.

    <title>Including and Excluding Files</title>

      <indexterm><primary>Code Coverage</primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>Blacklist</primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>Whitelist</primary></indexterm>

      By default, all sourcecode files that contain at least one line of code
      that has been executed (and only these files) are included in the report.
      The sourcecode files that are included in the report can be filtered by
      using a blacklist or a whitelist approach.
    </para>

    <para>
      The blacklist is pre-filled with all sourcecode files of PHPUnit itself
      as well as the tests. When the whitelist is empty (default), blacklisting
      is used. When the whitelist is not empty, whitelisting is used. Each file
      on the whitelist is added to the code coverage report regardless of
      whether or not it was executed. All lines of such a file, including those
      that are not executable, are counted as not executed.
    </para>

    <para>
      When you set <literal>processUncoveredFilesFromWhitelist="true"</literal>
      in your PHPUnit configuration (see <xref
      linkend="appendixes.configuration.blacklist-whitelist"/>) then these files
      will be included by PHP_CodeCoverage to properly calculate the number of
      executable lines.
    </para>

    <note>
      <para>
        Please note that the loading of sourcecode files that is performed when
        <literal>processUncoveredFilesFromWhitelist="true"</literal> is set can
        cause problems when a sourcecode file contains code outside the scope of
        a class or function, for instance.
      </para>
    </note>

    <para>
      PHPUnit's XML configuration file (see <xref linkend="appendixes.configuration.blacklist-whitelist"/>)
      can be used to control the blacklist and the whitelist. Using a whitelist
      is the recommended best practice to control the list of files included in
      the code coverage report.

    <para>
      For the most part it can safely be said that PHPUnit offers you "line
      based" code coverage information but due to how that information is
      collected there are some noteworthy edge cases.

    <example id="code-coverage-analysis.edge-cases.examples.Sample.php">
