  <title>Installing PHPUnit</title>

  <note>
    <para>
      PHPUnit 3.7 requires PHP 5.3.3 (or later), but PHP 5.5.1 (or later) is
      highly recommended.
    </para>

    <para>
      PHP_CodeCoverage, the library that is used by PHPUnit to collect and
      process code coverage information, depends on Xdebug 2.0.5 (or later),
      but Xdebug 2.2.3 (or later) is highly recommended.
    </para>
  </note>

  <section id="installation.phar">
    <title>PHP Archive (PHAR)</title>

    <para>
      The easiest way to obtain PHPUnit is to download a <ulink
      url="http://php.net/phar">PHP Archive (PHAR)</ulink> that has all required
      (as well as some optional) dependencies of PHPUnit bundled in a single
      file:
    </para>

    <screen><userinput>wget https://phar.phpunit.de/phpunit.phar</userinput>
<userinput>chmod +x phpunit.phar</userinput>
<userinput>mv phpunit.phar /usr/local/bin/phpunit</userinput></screen>

    <para>
      You can also immediately use the PHAR after you have downloaded it, of
      course:
    </para>

    <screen><userinput>wget https://phar.phpunit.de/phpunit.phar</userinput>
<userinput>php phpunit.phar</userinput></screen>
  </section>

  <section id="installation.composer">
    <title>Composer</title>

    <para>
      Simply add a dependency on <literal>phpunit/phpunit</literal> to your
      project's <literal>composer.json</literal> file if you use
      <ulink url="http://getcomposer.org/">Composer</ulink> to manage the
      dependencies of your project. Here is a minimal example of a
      <literal>composer.json</literal> file that just defines a development-time
      dependency on PHPUnit 3.7:
    </para>

    <programlisting><![CDATA[{
    "require-dev": {
        "phpunit/phpunit": "3.7.*"
    }
}]]></programlisting>

    <para>
      For a system-wide installation via Composer, you can run:
    </para>

    <screen><userinput>composer global require 'phpunit/phpunit=3.7.*'</userinput></screen>

    <para>
      Make sure you have <literal>~/.composer/vendor/bin/</literal> in your
      path.
    </para>

    <note>
      <para>
        Support for Composer and PHP Archive (PHAR) was added in PHPUnit 3.7
        (and is known to be stable since PHPUnit 3.7.5). Earlier releases of
        PHPUnit are not available through these distribution channels.

  <section id="installation.pear">
    <title>PEAR</title>

    <para>
      The following two commands (which you may have to run as
      <literal>root</literal>) are all that is required to install PHPUnit using
      the <ulink url="http://pear.php.net/manual/en/guide.users.commandline.cli.php">PEAR Installer</ulink>:
    </para>

    <screen><userinput>pear config-set auto_discover 1</userinput>
<userinput>pear install pear.phpunit.de/PHPUnit</userinput></screen>

    <caution>
      <para>
        Depending on your OS distribution and/or your PHP environment, you may
        need to install PEAR or update your existing PEAR installation before
        you can proceed with the instructions in this section.
      </para>

      <para>
        <userinput>sudo pear upgrade PEAR</userinput> usually suffices to
        upgrade an existing PEAR installation. The <ulink
        url="http://pear.php.net/manual/en/installation.getting.php">PEAR Manual</ulink>
        explains how to perform a fresh installation of PEAR.

    <title>Upgrading</title>

    <para>
      This section serves as a collection of minor BC issues that one might
      run into when upgrading from PHPUnit 3.6 to PHPUnit 3.7.
    </para>

    <para>
      The upgrade should be rather easy and work without any issues as it was
      tested against all major Open Source frameworks and there was not a
      single problem for them. Still every project is different and if you
      did not get around to trying one of the release candidates and have ran
      into an issue this document might provide some help.

          <para>
            The class <literal>PHPUnit_Extensions_OutputTestCase</literal> has
            been removed. PHPUnit 3.6 issued a deprecation notice when it was
            used. To see how output can now be tested look into
            <xref linkend="writing-tests-for-phpunit.output" />.

          <para>
            If a test changes the current working directory
            (<literal>cwd</literal>) PHPUnit ran into issues when generating
            code coverage output. Now that the cwd is restored after each
            test case you might find that one of your tests depended on
            another test changing the cwd. Something that isn't desirable
            anyways and should be easy to fix.

            When using custom test listeners as described in
            <xref linkend="appendixes.configuration.test-listeners"/> PHPUnit
            silently ignored missing test listeners and it was quite hard to
            debug that issues for the user. Now one autoload call will be
            triggered trying to locate the class. If your autoloader produces
            an error when it doesn't find a test listener you might run into an
            issue here. Removing the listener or making sure it's loaded in your
            <literal>bootstrap.php</literal> will solve this.

          <para>
            Previously all object parameters where cloned when mocking.
            This lead to issues when testing trying to check whether the same
            object was passed to method or not and other problem with
            uncloneable objects. As a long standing feature request by many
            this behavior was changed.

            When generating code coverage and using

            all uncovered files got included by PHPUnit. This was an issue for
            people with executable code in those files. PHPUnit will now scan
            the file and guess what code is executable and what code is not
            without including it. This might lead to different code coverage
            reports.

          <para>
            Since PHPUnit <literal>3.7.2</literal> we turned off the caching

            reports for big projects this cache consumed a lot of memory and
            due to the change in whitelist behavior it was problematic for
            folks with code bases with more than a couple of thousand classes.

          <para>
            If your project is smaller or you have enough memory you will get
            a runtime benefit by adding <literal>cacheTokens="true"</literal>
            to your <literal>phpunit.xml</literal> file. See
